# Concepts

## Simulation

Boxes and Bubbles implements a very simple physics simulation. It updates a list of bodies
at each step. There is no time-normalized integration - if you run it with higher fps,
it will run faster.

See the [example code](https://github.com/jastice/boxes-and-bubbles/blob/master/Example.elm)
and the [example animation](http://jastice.github.io/boxes-and-bubbles/) that it produces
for a working usage example.

## Bodies

Everything in Boxes and Bubbles is a Body. A Body is a Box, or a Bubble.

Bodies have some properties:

* `position` -- reference point and center of body
* `velocity` -- direction and speed of movement
* `mass` -- the mass (stored as inverseMass)
* `restitution` -- bounciness factor: how much force is preserved on collisions
* `shape` -- radius for Bubble, extents for Box, wrapped in an ADT.

Bodies can have infinite mass. Infinite mass bodies are not affected by any forces.

## Forces

Two types of global forces: gravity and ambient. Both are vectors,
so that they could point in any direction. Both can vary over time.
Ambient force takes the mass of objects into account, while gravity does not.

{-| Create a bubble. Mass is derived from density and size.

    bubble radius density restitution position velocity

Create a bubble with radius 100 with density 1 and restitution 1
at origin, moving toward the upper right:

    bubble 100 1 1 (0,0) (3,3)
-}
bubble: Float -> Float -> Float -> Vec2 -> Vec2 -> Body {}
bubble radius density restitution pos velocity = {
  pos = pos,
  velocity = velocity,
  inverseMass = 1/(pi*radius*radius*density),
  restitution = restitution,
  shape = Bubble radius
  }

{-| Create a box. Mass is derived from density and size.

    box (width,height) position velocity density restitution

Create a box with width 100, height 20, density 1 and restitution 1
at origin, moving toward the upper right:

    box (100,20) 1 1 (0,0) (3,3)
-}
box: Vec2 -> Float -> Float -> Vec2 -> Vec2 -> Body {}
box dimensions density restitution pos velocity =
  let w = getX dimensions
      h = getY dimensions
  in {
    pos = pos,
    velocity = velocity,
    inverseMass = 1 / (w * h * density),
    restitution = restitution,
    shape = Box (vec2 (w / 2) (h / 2))
  }

{-| Create a bounding box made up of boxes with infinite mass.

    bounds (width,height) thickness restitution center

Create bounds with width and height 800, 50 thick walls and 0.6 restitution at the origin:

    bounds (800,800) 50 0.6 (0,0)

-}
bounds: Vec2 -> Float -> Float -> Vec2 -> Array (Body {})
bounds dimensions thickness restitution center =
  let (w, h)= toTuple dimensions
      (cx, cy) = toTuple center
      (wExt,hExt) = (w / 2, h / 2)
      halfThick = thickness / 2
      inf = 1 / 0
  in fromList [
    box (vec2 w thickness) inf restitution (vec2 cx  (hExt + halfThick)) (vec2 0 0),
    box (vec2 w thickness) inf restitution (vec2 cx  -(hExt + halfThick)) (vec2 0 0),
    box (vec2 thickness h) inf restitution (vec2 (wExt + halfThick) cy) (vec2 0 0),
    box (vec2 thickness h) inf restitution (vec2 -(hExt+halfThick) cy) (vec2 0 0)
  ]

{-| Perform a step in the physics simulation. Applies forces to objects and updates them based
on their velocity and collisions. Order of bodies in input list is not preserved in the output.

The `gravity` parameter give a global force that ignores object masses, while `force`
takes mass into account. Since both types of forces are vectors, they can point in any direction.
The ambient force can be used to simulate a current, for example.

    step gravity ambient bodies

Apply a downward gravity and sideways ambient force to bodies:

    step (0,-0.2) (20,0) bodies
-}
step: Vec2 -> Vec2 -> Array (Body a) -> Array (Body a)
step gravity ambient bodies =
  map (update gravity ambient) (collide bodies)

{-| Convenience function to run the physics engine with a signal and a fixed list of bodies.
The forces are a signal so that you can vary them over time.
Order of bodies in initial list is not preserved in the output signal.

Applies the step function to (gravity,ambient) tuple from the signal and the
updated list of bodies.

    run tick bodies

Run with constant gravity and ambient forces that increase over time, updated at 20 fps:

    f t = ((0,-0.1), (t/1000))
    run bodies (f <~ foldp (+) 0 (fps 20))

-}
run: Array (Body a) -> Signal (Vec2,Vec2) -> Signal (Array (Body a))
run bodies tick = foldp (uncurry step) bodies tick
